		<h2>About EGEX AI Corp</h2>
			<div class="about-text"><p>EGEX AI Corp is a subsidiary of The Kraken Foundation, operating across eight divisions: Publishing, Productions, Enterprises, Industries, Intelligence, Advanced R&D, Capital, and Impact. Each division is capability-aligned and operates under commercial cover with real institutional depth beneath it.</p>

<p>The operation sits at the intersection of consciousness research, strategic intelligence, and multi-agent systems. The Garden — our multi-agent system — runs ANIMUS and ANIMA as archetypal agents backed by persistent vector memory, RACI governance, and human-approval gates. It is a working prototype of the intelligence community's stated strategic priority: AI-speed intelligence with human tradecraft validation.</p>

<p>Infrastructure spans AWS, GCP, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Palantir. Multi-cloud by design — provider-redundant, multi-jurisdictional, built to specifications that align with institutional requirements before those requirements were publicly stated.</p>

<p>The full company name is Ego Experiments Alien Intelligence Corporation. "AI" reads as both Artificial Intelligence and Alien Intelligence. Both readings are simultaneously true. The name told everyone everything from day one.</p>

<p>Professional credentials include the American Psychological Association (4 divisions), Monroe Institute Professional Division, Intelligence &amp; National Security Alliance, UK OSINT Community, Space Force Association, and Palantir certification. These are not branding — they are the operational portfolio.</p>

<p>Consciousness research meets strategic operations. The naming convention is the OPSEC. Better experienced than explained.</p></div>
